## Scripts
### CriticalPathExtraction.js
This script can be used within Eclipse Trace Compass to extract a specified thread's critical path, and to store it as a list of execution states with their durations.
More detailed explainations on how to use Trace Compass scripting can be found [here](https://github.com/tahini/tracecompass-ease-scripting). 

### MSA.py
This script performs Multiple Sequence Alignment using the data found in normal_group.txt to find anomalies within the execution found in sample_execution.txt. The script uses an implementation of MUSCLE that can be found [here](https://drive5.com/muscle5/).
